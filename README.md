# lbi -- A Go Weight Round Robin Load Balancer

A simple yet powerful load balancer implemented in Go. This project demonstrates how to build a load balancer from scratch, featuring weighted round-robin load balancing, health checks, and reverse proxying.

## Features
- **Weighted Round Robin:** Distributes requests based on backend server weights.
- **Health Checks:** Periodically checks the health of backend servers and removes unhealthy ones.
- **Reverse Proxy:** Forwards incoming requests to healthy backend servers.
- **Concurrency:** Uses goroutines for non-blocking health checks.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iliasreg/lbi.git
   cd lbi
   ```
   
Build and run the load balancer:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Usage
Start Backend Servers
Start some backend servers using Python‚Äôs built-in HTTP server:

  ```bash
  # Terminal 1
  python3 -m http.server 8081
  
  # Terminal 2
  python3 -m http.server 8082
  
  # Terminal 3
  python3 -m http.server 8083
  ```

## Start the Load Balancer
Run the load balancer:

  ```bash
  go run main.go
  ```

## Send Requests
Send requests to the load balancer using curl or a browser:

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8080
  ```

---

## Observe Behavior
The load balancer will forward requests to the backend servers in a weighted round-robin fashion.
If a backend server becomes unhealthy, the load balancer will stop forwarding requests to it.
